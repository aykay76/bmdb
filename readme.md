Another project from the archives that I have uploaded to git in case it can be of use to anyone starting out with simple in-memory/small-file databases. I first created this project back in 1999 as a simple indexed database that could be used for small projects that didn't require a full blown relational database.

With the rise in popularity of microservices and containerised workloads this could become useful again, who knows?

It's very simple and could easily be translated to other languages, containerised etc.
